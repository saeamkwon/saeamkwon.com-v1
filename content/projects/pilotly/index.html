              For an easier and usable survey creation process, I designed for better arrangement, copy, and a simple, modern interface. The redesign also allows for flexibility and less preparation before creating the electronic survey.

            The number one reason that was causing issues for Pilotly was information architecture. The placement of a lot of components were right to left which was not intuitive to the native English speaking/reading. Structure of the process was grouped to fewer steps using different information architecture which never led the user to a possible dead end.

            Going into the survey tab, instead of directly leading them to the form to create a new survey, it was consolidated to a view where users can create new surveys and see old surveys. One, recreating an existing survey would not be the most efficient use of time. Two, although shortening the process would be convenient, the feeling of being dumped into the beginning of a process abruptly is not something anyone likes.
