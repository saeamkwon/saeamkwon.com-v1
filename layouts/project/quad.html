              Quad is Y-Combinator startup that helps students answer, "What do I need to get done?". By bringing together all their assignments and classmates in one place, students are able to get more done and ultimately succeed.

              <p class="fade-1-4 lead mb40">
                The initial style of Quad was sleek and sophisticated. Individual flows were dark themed which made it obvious to the user that they were in a flow to complete a specific action. However, given the collaborative nature of the app, this dark theme did not evoke the sense of openness that was desired.

              <h5 class="uppercase bold mb16">The Solution:</h5>
              <p class="fade-1-4 lead mb40">
                The design style was changed to evoke a sense of openness and sharing amongst college students. This was accomplished by using a lighter color palette, adding playful illustrations, and simplifying app flows.

            <p class="mb40 lead fade-1-4">
                Quad's previous design was sleek and sophisticated so many flows were dark themed. This was the flow for adding an assignment on Quad.

            <p class="mb0 lead fade-1-4">
              One of the main issues with this flow was while the form seems simple at first, the form gains two additional inputs as the user fills it out. These additional inputs that appeared often shocked the user and made the form unnecessarily lengthy. In addition, the dark colors evoked a sense of exclusivity that conflicted with the idea that assignments are shared amongst classmates.

            <h3>After: Dark to Light</h3>
            <p class="mb40 lead fade-1-4">
                With a new style direction, the flow was redesigned to be more simple and easy to follow with a light blue interface.
            </p>

        <div class="row mb0 mb-xs-24">

            <h5 class="mb16 uppercase bold">Responsive Forms</h5>
            <p class="mb56 lead fade-1-4">
              To address the perception of a long (and changing) process, the form was consolidated into 3 input fields that stayed consistent. This was accomplished by making the the Due Date input lead to an overlay hence the arrow present on the right side. This eliminated the number of taps by half and made the process shorter.

              The splash screens are the first screens seen by a new user when opening the app. The goal is to get users to sign up so each screen needed to be clear without feeling overwhelming. Instead of showcasing app screenshots highlighting the main features, illustrations are used for fast comprehension and cleaner design.
